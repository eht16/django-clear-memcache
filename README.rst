Overview
========

Allow to clear Memcache items for the current site (according to the cache key prefix)
or even to clear the whole configured Memcache server.
The app integrates into Django's admin interface for easy use.


Installation
============

- Dependencies

  - Django 2.1 or newer

- Install:

    pip install django-clear-memcache

- Add `django_clear_memcache` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

- If not already done, configure `CACHES` to have a default cache
  with one of the supported Memcache backends (`django.core.cache.backends.memcached.*`)
  and set a `KEY_PREFIX`.

Usage
=====

Open the admin interface and find the new menu item "Clear Memcache".
There you can clear cache items for the configured `KEY_PREFIX` or
even the whole Memcache server.

Furthermore, you can list known items in the cache for the configured `KEY_PREFIX`.
